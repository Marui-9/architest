ArchiTest is a local-first developer tool that converts your Docker-based architecture into a visual integration map where every service connection can be executed and verified as a contract test.

It is not a diagramming tool.
It is not an API client.
It is not a test framework.

It is a visual contract execution layer on top of your existing system.

Core Experience (MVP)
1. Boot

User runs:

docker run -p 3000:3000 architest/core

Opens localhost:3000.

Dark-mode graph canvas appears.

2. Repository Connection

User selects local project folder.

ArchiTest scans:

docker-compose.yml

OpenAPI files (default paths only, configurable later)

No AI. Deterministic parsing only.

3. Architecture Map Generation

ArchiTest builds a graph:

Nodes (Boxes)

Derived from Docker services:

frontend

user-api

postgres

Each node shows:

Service name

Exposed port

OpenAPI availability indicator

Edges (Arrows)

Edges are created when:

A service depends_on another service in Docker

AND the target service exposes an OpenAPI spec

Edges represent:

"Consumer service → Provider API contract"

4. Edge Inspection Panel

Click an edge.

Right-side panel shows:

Detected base URL

List of endpoints from OpenAPI

Method + route

Expected response codes

Response schema summary

User selects one endpoint.

5. Generate & Run Contract Test

When clicked:

ArchiTest generates a Playwright API test internally using:

Playwright API testing mode.

The generated test does:

Send request to service container

Validate:

Status code matches spec

Response matches OpenAPI schema

It does not:

Assert business logic

Validate DB state

Require auth flows (initially)

6. Visual Feedback

Edge states:

Gray: Not tested

Green: Contract verified

Red: Contract failed

Yellow: Spec mismatch detected

Hovering edge shows:

Last run timestamp

Response time

Status code

Failure reason (if any)

This transforms the architecture diagram into a live system map.

What the MVP Explicitly Does NOT Do

To avoid overreach:

No browser automation

No test editing UI

No multi-environment support

No CI integration

No AI-generated tests

No drift detection beyond basic spec mismatch

That is Phase 2+.

The Psychological Hook

The user sees:

Their real architecture

Their real API contracts

Their real containers

Tested instantly

Reflected visually

The green arrow moment is the product.

Differentiation from Existing Tools
Tool	What It Does	Why ArchiTest Is Different
Postman	Manual API testing	Not architecture-aware
Swagger UI	Spec visualization	Not executable system-wide
Playwright	Code-based testing	No architectural abstraction

ArchiTest’s abstraction layer is:

Service edge = executable contract.

That is the innovation.

Ideal Early Adopter

Teams using Docker Compose locally

Backend-first SaaS startups

Platform engineers enforcing API contracts

Microservice teams with OpenAPI discipline

Not:

Legacy monolith shops

No-Docker teams

No-spec teams

Future Expansion Path (After MVP Success)

Authentication helpers (token auto-injection)

Frontend → API E2E using Playwright browser mode

CI mode with JSON export

Drift detection on PRs

Historical integration health tracking

Multi-repo service graph

Final Refined Positioning Statement

ArchiTest is a local-first visual contract testing tool that converts Docker + OpenAPI systems into an executable architecture map, allowing teams to see and verify service integrations instantly.
